      Guinea pigs, also known as cavies, are small, gentle rodents originally from the Andes mountains in South America. They are popular pets due to their calm temperament, social nature, and adorable squeaks. Guinea pigs thrive in pairs or small groups and love gentle handling.
      These little animals need a balanced diet rich in hay, fresh vegetables, and specially formulated pellets. They require a clean, spacious habitat and regular interaction to stay happy and healthy.
      Guinea pigs communicate through a variety of sounds — from happy “wheeks” to contented purring. They’re great companions for families and beginners alike, providing hours of joy with their playful and loving behavior.
